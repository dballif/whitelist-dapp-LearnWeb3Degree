# Whitelist Dapp
This is one of the projects from the [LearnWeb3 Ethereum Developer Degree](https://learnweb3.io/degrees/ethereum-developer-degree/)

The premise of the app is to create a basic whitelist for which certain addresses can be added to get a free NFT. The project also contains a basic ERC721 contract for the NFTs in question. 

It sets a max value for the tokens on creation, sets a base price, and allows addresses on the whitelist to get their free NFT. It also keeps track of how manyh whitelisted NFTs have been claimed to make sure there are enough reserved for those on the whitelist.
